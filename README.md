# TrigTools
A suite of useful applications for students in trigonometry 


v1.0.1 Notes:

Installation:

1. Download the TI Connect CE Software [here](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/CA9C74CAD02440A69FDC7189D7E1B6C2/swticonnectcesoftware) and install it to your computer.

2. Download the TrigTools Zip File from the release page [here](https://github.com/StarlitMantis/TrigTools/releases/tag/v1.0.1) and save it to a place you can easily find.

3. Open the TI Connect CE app and plug your calculator into your computer. On the far left of the app click the icon that looks like a pile of papers that brings you to the connected calculator screen. On the top toolbar there is an icon with a computer with an arrow going to the top left that says â€œadd content from your computer to connected calculator(s).

(Make note if you have a previous installation and other software you would like to keep on your calculator press 2nd > mem > Mem Management/Delete > 7  and then select the appropriate files with the arrow keys and select delete to remove them. Otherwise you can just reset it by pressing 2nd > mem> 7 > 1 > 2)

4. Navigate to the TRIGTOOL file you just downloaded. Click open and then click send. You now have the TrigTools installed!

Using TrigTools:
Run the TRIGTOOL program after installing it to your TI-84 Plus CE. (This version does not support the TI-84 Plus. There will be another version that will add support)

In this section, I will explain how to use every app from one to nine. Make note that the Triangle Calculator app is the most complex and will require the most time to explain, the other apps are simpler. 

1.  Triangle Calc

You are greeted with some gorgeous ascii art of a triangle. This triangle explains the relationship of angles to sides.

![Ascii Art](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54572669/209927307-e7a94a12-6aeb-45d2-b875-0e6614e6421e.png)

This is just a generic drawing, the triangles do not need to be right triangles. Clicking the enter key will bring you to the next page.

![Rules](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54572669/209927313-c35530fc-7029-4693-b575-98ab1726f664.png)

This is a reminder of the relationships between the angles and sides that was visualized in the ascii art. You now must enter your three values one by one clicking enter each time. Leave the unknown values as zero. After entering your last value the triangle will be solved and the answer will be displayed in A,B,C,X,Y,Z on separate lines. This app will calculate in either degree or radians based off the mode your calculator is set in. To switch modes, exit the app and press mode > using the arrow keys select degree > press enter. (Radian/Degree is on the third row)

![Tri 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54572669/209927314-33a31146-7558-45ec-b6d0-f39093449e4f.png)

If there is a second triangle you can click enter to view it. 

![Tri 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54572669/209927304-4828a421-e91a-47a5-b352-f8d744f736a5.png)

The program is completed, and you can access all the variables by typing them. Say you wanted to add together the sides to find the perimeter you can type A+B+C and find the perimeter.
Clicking enter after the program has completed will restart it and bring you back to the TrigTools home screen.

3. Radians to Degrees

Simply type in your radian and click enter and it will be converted. This app will work in degree or radian mode.

4. Degrees to Radians 

Enter your degrees and click enter and it will be converted. This app works in either degree or radian mode.

5. Angle Between 2 Vectors

Assuming your vectors are in cartesian form <X,Y>, enter both vectors and the app will find the angle in either degrees or radians based off the mode your calculator is.

6. Pythagorean Theorem

Assuming there is one unknown enter known values in the form A^2+B^2=C^2 and leave the unknown as a zero

7. Vector Projection 

Assuming your vectors is in cartesian form <X,Y>, enter the vector that is being projected onto the second vector first and then enter the vector that will have the first vector projected on it. The app will output the magnitude the projected vector as well as the cartesian form.

8. Dot Product

Assuming your vectors are in cartesian form <X,Y>, enter both vectors and the app will find the dot product of the two. 

9. <A,B> to R,Theta

This app will convert a cartesian vector or point into R, Theta form. This app works in either degree or radian mode and will give theta in the mode you have selected. Enter the vector <A,B> or point (A,B) and the R and Theta Values will be found. 

10. Quit

This app is pretty straight forward.

This concludes a brief how to on TrigTools.
