# TrigTools
A suite of useful applications for students in trigonometry 


V1.0 Notes:

Installation:

1. Download the TI Connect CE Software [here](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/CA9C74CAD02440A69FDC7189D7E1B6C2/swticonnectcesoftware) and install it to your computer.

2. Download the TrigTools Zip File from the release page [here](link) and extract the file to a new folder. Save said folder to a place you can easily find.

3. Open the TI Connect CE app and plug your calculator into your computer. On the far left of the app click the icon that looks like a pile of papers that brings you to the connected calculator screen. On the top toolbar there is an icon with a computer with an arrow going to the top left that says “add content from your computer to connected calculator(s).

4. Navigate to your extracted folder and select every file in the folder. Click open and then on the next screen click “Replace existing content with the same name on destination calculators” if you have downloaded a previous version of my software. Click send and now you have the TrigTools installed!

Using TrigTools:
Run the AAATOOLS program after installing all the to your TI-84 Plus CE. (This version does not support the TI-84 Plus, there will be another version that will add support)

In this section I will explain how to use every app from one to eight. Make note that the Triangle Calculator app is the most complex and will require the most time to explain, the other apps are simpler. 

1.  Triangle Calc
(Make sure your calculator is in degree mode)
You are greeted with some gorgeous ascii art of a triangle. This triangle explains the relationship of angles to sides.

![Ascii Art](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54572669/209927307-e7a94a12-6aeb-45d2-b875-0e6614e6421e.png)

This is just a generic drawing, the triangles do not need to be right triangles. Clicking the enter key will bring you to the next page.

![Rules](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54572669/209927313-c35530fc-7029-4693-b575-98ab1726f664.png)

This is a reminder of the relationships between the angles and sides that was visualized in the ascii art. You now must enter your three values one by one clicking enter each time. Leave the unknown values as zero. After entering your last value the triangle will be solved and the answer will be displayed in A,B,C,X,Y,Z on separate lines.

![Tri 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54572669/209927314-33a31146-7558-45ec-b6d0-f39093449e4f.png)

If there is a second triangle you can click enter to view it. 

![Tri 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54572669/209927304-4828a421-e91a-47a5-b352-f8d744f736a5.png)

The program is completed, and you can access all the variables by typing them. Say you wanted to add together the sides to find the perimeter you can type A+B+C and find the perimeter.
Clicking enter after the program has completed will restart it and bring you back to the TrigTools home screen.

2. Radians to Degrees
Simply type in your radian and click enter and it will be converted. This app will work in degree or radian mode.

3. Degrees to Radians 
Enter your degrees and click enter and it will be converted. This app works in either degree or radian mode.

4. Angle Between 2 Vectors
Assuming your vectors are in cartesian form <X,Y>, enter both vectors and the app will find the angle in either degrees or radians based off the mode your calculator is.

5. Pythagorean Theorem
Assuming there is one unknown enter known values in the form A^2+B^2=C^2 and leave the unknown as a zero

6. Vector Projection 
Assuming your vectors is in cartesian form <X,Y>, enter the vector that is being projected onto the second vector first and then enter the vector that will have the first vector projected on it. The app will output the magnitude the projected vector as well as the cartesian form.

7. Dot Product
Assuming your vectors are in cartesian form <X,Y>, enter both vectors and the app will find the dot product of the two. 

8. <A,B> to R,Theta
This app will convert a cartesian vector or point into R, Theta form. This app works in either degree or radian mode and will give theta in the mode you have selected. Enter the vector <A,B> or point (A,B) and the R and Theta Values will be found. 

9. Quit
This app is pretty straight forward.

This concludes a brief how to on TrigTools. This is the first version of the app and on later versions there will be several bug fixes and quality of life improvements. My main goal right now is to condense the 36 files into one file and add more apps that will help along your trigonometry ventures.
